    <h2>LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT WHY THE GAME IS SO ENTERTAINING/POPULAR:</h2>
    <br>
    <img align="right" width="0" height="0" src="">
<h2>HERE ARE 3 REASONS THIS GAME IS SO GOOD (FROM THE COMMUNITY):</h2>
    
  <p>REASON- TACTICAL GAMEPLAY - THIS IS WHAT MAKES SIEGE SO DIFFERENT AND UNIQUE THAN ANY OTHER GAME..<p>
    <p>YOU HAVE TO USE STRATEGIC PLANNING AND COME TOGETHER WITH TEAMATES TO UNDERSTAND WHERE AND HOW TO USE OPERATERS, TRAPS, AND LASTLY COMMUNICATION.</p>
    <p>THIS GAMEPLAY IS UNIQUE AND DIFFERENT FROM THE REST, THEREBY OFFERING AN ENGAGING AND IMMERSIVE GAMING EXPERIENCE.

    </p>
  <br>
  
  <p>REASON 2- STRATEGIC DEPTH - THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT SKILLS TO HAVE WHILE YOUR PLAYING R6.</p>
  <p>I CAN NOT STRESS IT ENOUGH, IQ IN SIEGE IS HANDS-DOWN THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO WIN THE GAME. </p>
  <p>IF YOU USE GOOD IQ YOU CAN KNOW WHEN TO FIGHT, WHAT OPERATERS THE OTHER TEAM IS USING, OR EVEN WHEN THE OTHER TEAM IS GOING TO PLANT/USE THERE ABLITY.</p>
  <p>IN ALL, IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO INHERIT A GOOD IQ IF YOU WANT TO WIN GAMES AND RANK UP.</p>
    
   <br>
  
  <p>REASON 3- STRONG COMMUNITY - THIS IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE ONLY REASONS SIEGE HAS ITS LONGEVITY.<p>
    <p>AS I HAVE PLAYED THIS GAME IN MY LIFETIME, I HAVE NOTICED THAT THE COMMUNITY IS LIKE NO OTHER!</p>
    <p>WHETHER ITS ALWAYS TALKING THRU CHANGES/BUGS, OR HELPING BEGINNERS GET BETTER AND UNDERSTAND THE GAME.</p>
    <p>I SAID IT ONCE AND ILL SAY IT AGAIN SIEGE HAS THE STRONGEST COMMUNITY I HAVE EVER SEEN!</p>
    <br>
<h2>THOSE ARE JUST A FEW REASONS THIS GAME IS SO GOOD, I COULD GO ON FOREVER!</h2>
